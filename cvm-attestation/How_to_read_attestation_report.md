# Reading the SNP TCB Version from SNP Attestation Report

This document provides a detailed guide on how to retrieve the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) version from an AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) Confidential VM. The TCB version is crucial for verifying the security and integrity of the virtual machine environment. Follow the steps outlined below to accurately collect and interpret the TCB version information.

# Windows
The following instructions are for Windows Confidential VMs.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that Git is installed on your system before proceeding with the following steps.

### Option 1: Download from the Official Website
Download Git from the official Git website:
[https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

> Once the executable is downloaded, follow the setup instructions provided by the installer.

### Option 2: Download using winget
To download Git using the winget tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the winget tool is installed on your system. If it is not installed, you can download it from the official Microsoft documentation: [Install winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget).
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the following command to install Git:
  ```powershell
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
  ```

## Installing the Confidential VM Attestation Tools for Windows
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Clone the cvm-attestation-tools repository:
  ```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/Azure/cvm-attestation-tools.git
  ```
3. Navigate to the cvm-attestation folder:
  ```powershell
  cd cvm-attestation-tools/cvm-attestation/
  ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the installation script:
  ```powershell
  .\install.ps1
  ```

### Sample Output
After installing the dependencies, the output should look like the following:

```
> .\install.ps1

> **NOTE:** Ensure there are no errors and verify that the tools are installed successfully by checking for the message `Finished processing dependencies for attest==0.1`.


# Linux
The following instructions are for Confidential VMs running Linux.

## Installing the Confidential VM Attestation Tools for Linux
1. Open a terminal.
2. Clone the cvm-attestation-tools repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Azure/cvm-attestation-tools.git
  ```
3. Navigate to the cvm-attestation folder:
  ```bash
  cd cvm-attestation-tools/cvm-attestation/
  ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the installation script:
  ```bash
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

### Sample Output
After installing the dependencies, the output should look like the following:

```
$ sudo ./install.sh

# Retrieving the SNP Attestation Report
## Windows
To retrieve the attestation report, run the following command:
  ```powershell
  .\read_report.ps1
  ```
  > **NOTE:** Ensure you run PowerShell as an administrator because the tool requires elevated privileges to access the Virtual TPM.

## Linux
To retrieve the attestation report, run the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo ./read_report.sh
  ```
  > **NOTE:** We use `sudo` to run the script with root privileges because the tool requires elevated permissions to access the Virtual TPM.

## Reading TCB Version
This tool displays the different TCB versions in HEX format (Big Endian) as well as in a human-readable format.

### Breakdown Example
```
Current TCB: DB16000000000004
  Microcode:   219
  SNP:         22
  TEE:         0
  Boot Loader: 4
```

### Different TCB versions from Logs
The logs provide various TCB versions, each representing a different state of the Trusted Computing Base. Below is an example of how these versions are logged:
- **Current TCB version**: The TCB version currently in use.
- **Reported TCB version**: The TCB version reported by the attestation report.
- **Committed TCB version**: The TCB version that has been committed.
- **Launched TCB version**: The TCB version at the time of the VM launch.

These versions help in understanding the security posture and the integrity of the virtual machine environment.

```
> By comparing these versions, we can verify that the TCB of the machine running the CVM aligns with AMD's released versions.
