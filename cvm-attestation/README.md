# Python Attestation Sample App
Remote Attestation empowers a `relying party`, whether it be the workload owner or the user, to authenticate that their workload is operating on a platform equipped with `Intel TDX` technology before divulging sensitive information. In this instance, we undertake the assessment of the `Hardware Report's` integrity and trustworthiness through the services of an Attestation Provider. This application serves as an instructive demonstration highlighting the implementation of Remote Attestation using Python programming language.

## Overview

![Attestation](img/attest.png)

## Intall Dependencies and Build CLI Tool
Install all the dependencies and build the CLI tool called `attest`
```
sudo ./install
```

## Uninstall the `attest` CLI Tool
For uninstalling the cli tool run the following command:
```
pip3 uninstall attest -y
```

## Run CLI Tool
To run the cli tool use one of the following commands:
### SNP (MAA Only)
```
sudo attest  --c config_snp.json
```
### TDX with MAA
```
sudo attest  --c config_tdx.json
```

### TDX with Intel Trust Authority
```
sudo attest  --c config_tdx_ita.json
```
**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to add the `api_key` to the config file.

### `--c` Config File Option
Option to set config file
```
attest  --c config_sample.json
```

### `--t` Attestation Type Option
Option to provide type of attestation to be run

#### Platform
Attest the Hardware using the Machines Hardware Report
```
attest  --c config_sample.json --t Platform
```

#### Guest
Attest the Hardware and the Guest measurements
```
attest  --c config_sample.json --t Guest
```


The console output will contain the `Token` returned by the Attestation Provider as well as some of the claims parsed from the token.
