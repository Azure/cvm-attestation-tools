Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a security component forming roots of trust in many PCs, servers and mobile devices. TPMs provide security functionality in the areas of:

- Cryptographic key generation, protection, management, and use
- Cryptographic device identity
- Secure logging and log-reporting, i.e., attestation
- Secure non-volatile storage
- Other functions including hashing, random number generation, a secure clock, etc.
