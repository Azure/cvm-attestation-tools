# Attestation

Remote Attestation empowers a relying party, whether it be the workload owner or the user, to authenticate that their workload is operating on a platform equipped with Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP technology. This authentication should be done before providing sensitive information into the Guest workload. Currently, we support two forms of attestation: `platform` and `guest`, which are described below.


## 1. Install git to clone the required tools

### _Windows_
The following instructions are for Windows Confidential VMs.

#### Option 1: Download from the Official Website
Download Git from the official Git website:
[https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

> Once the executable is downloaded, follow the setup instructions provided by the installer.

#### Option 2: Download using winget
To download Git using the winget tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the winget tool is installed on your system. If it is not installed, you can download it from the official Microsoft documentation: [Install winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget).
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Run the following command to install Git:
  ```powershell
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
  ```
  ```

### _Linux_
The git tools should already be part of the Linux guest. To verify if git is installed, run the following command:

## 2. Install the Confidential VM Attestation Tools

### _Windows_
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Clone the cvm-attestation-tools repository:
  ```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/Azure/cvm-attestation-tools.git
  ```
3. Navigate to the cvm-attestation folder:
  ```powershell
  cd cvm-attestation-tools/cvm-attestation/
  ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the installation script:
  ```powershell
  .\install.ps1
  ```

#### Sample Output
After installing the dependencies, the output should look like the following:
```
> .\install.ps1

## 3. Running Attestation

### Guest Attestation
Guest attestation verifies that the CVM is running in either Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP hardware. Additionally, it verifies that the CVM is an `Azure CVM` by collecting hardware evidence (aka. hardware report and runtime data) and Guest OS measurements.

#### Linux
Run `guest attestation` using the following command:
```
sudo attest --c config_snp_guest.json --t guest
```

#### Windows
Run `guest attestation` using the following command:
```
attest --c config_snp_guest.json --t guest
```

#### Output
```

```

### Platform Attestation
Platform attestation verifies that the CVM is running in an Intel TDX or AMD SEV-SNP hardware.

#### Linux
Run `platform attestation` using the following command:
```
sudo attest --c config_snp.json
```

#### Windows
Run `platform attestation` using the following command:
```
attest --c config_snp.json
```

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> **To run `Platform Attestation` on TDX, use the `config_tdx.json` for MAA or `config_tdx_ita.json` for Intel's Trust Authority.**

2025-02-07 18:13:00,408 - print_snp_platform_claims - INFO - Attested Platform Successfully!!
```

## 4. Verify the Results
After running the sample app, we should see the message one of the following messages `Attested Platform Successfully!!` or `Attested Guest Successfully!!`. This means that the attestation provider was able to verify the information successfully and a token is returned.

### Verifying User Claims
To check that the unique claims provided are inscribed into the hardware report, check that the user claim hash matches the `user-claims` hash digest returned during attestation.


#### User provided claims
From the configuration file we can read the `claims` object, then take the SHA512 of the entire JSON object, and pass it to the attestation tool to include it in the hardware report. In the logs, we can check this value which is printed before attestation is performed.
```
2025-02-07 18:37:59,195 - attest - INFO - claims: {'user-claims': {'nonce': 'Hello This Was Generated By Javier'}}
2025-02-07 18:37:59,196 - attest - INFO - SHA512 of user provided claims: 4BD03DC197F0BF46D4D40480925401BE4FC55D6EFD05095D867EBA038F4432BB0F2EA7F0D8AAE01811044038FE61ED662866C7E67A5482CD94DB0069B67717AE
```

#### Claims in the `Hardware Report`
```
2025-02-07 18:38:02,714 - print_guest_claims - INFO - User Claims Digest: 4BD03DC197F0BF46D4D40480925401BE4FC55D6EFD05095D867EBA038F4432BB0F2EA7F0D8AAE01811044038FE61ED662866C7E67A5482CD94DB0069B67717AE
```

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> Both claims from the logs above should match.
To check all the fields returned by the attestation provider in the token, use the following steps.

1. Look for the token in the logs
```
2025-02-07 18:38:02,713 - attest_guest - INFO - TOKEN:
Token will be printed below>
```
2. Use any of the JSON web token decoder
    - [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms/)
    - [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
3. Copy the Token to the jwt decoder
